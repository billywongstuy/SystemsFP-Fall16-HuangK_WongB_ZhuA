Description:
A statement of the problem you are solving and/or a high level description of the project.

Big Two
We will be implementing a terminal based version of the card game Big Two, colloquially referred to as Chinese Poker. This will allow for 2-4 players on different computers to play the game together.

User Interface/How It Will Be Used:
-Player will have their hand on bottom
-Number of cards other players have will be on left, top, right
-Center will have most recently player card(s)
-Turn player can select their option with keyboard commands:
  -Will be told what option they have (single, double, triples, 5 card combinations, freebie)
  -P for Pass
  -Choose by numerical value (Each card in their hand is given a numerical value)
  -Numerical values separated by commas
  -Will be told if a move is valid or not
  

Technical Design (topics, data structures, algorithms):

-Networking between computers to play the game
-Structs for the different card types
-File reading/writing and shared memory to keep track of hands and most recently played card(s) and used cards
-Semaphores to block other players from doing an action
-Arrays for player hands
-Signals to determine sigterms
-Sorting to align the cards for 5 card combinations
-Inputs and string parsing to determine the turn player's move
