Description:
A statement of the problem you are solving and/or a high level description of the project.

Big Two
We will be implementing a terminal based version of the card game Big Two, colloquially referred to as Chinese Poker. This will allow for 2-4 players on different computers to play the game together.


User Interface/How It Will Be Used:

-Player will have their hand on bottom
-Number of cards other players have will be on left, top, and right (Player is not shown their hand)
-Center of the screen will show the most recent card(s)
-Players can select their option with keyboard commands:
  -P for Pass
  -C to check used cards pile
-Players will be told what options they have to play (single, double, triples, 5 card combinations, freebie)
  -Choose by numerical value (Each card in their hand is given a numerical value)
  -Numerical values separated by commas
  -Will be told if a move is valid or not
  

Technical Design (topics, data structures, algorithms):

-Memory allocation for every C program
-Networking between computers to play the game
-Pipes to communicate between different players
-File reading/writing and shared memory to keep track of hands and most recently played card(s) and used cards
-Semaphores and shared memory to prevent other players from an action when it is not their turn
-Signals to determine sigterms and handle errors
-Inputs and string parsing to determine the turn player's move

-Structs for the different card types
-Arrays for players' hands

-Sorting to align the cards for 5-card combinations
-Randomization to shuffle the cards and randomly distribute
